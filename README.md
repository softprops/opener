# opener

> open with something good

Opener provides interfaces for opening files on your desktop using this [tool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html) which may or may not be available. When it's not, that's okay too. 

## usage

```scala
import java.net.URI
opener.Browse(new URI(https://github.com/softprops/opener#readme))
```
